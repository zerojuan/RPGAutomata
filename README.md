RPG Automata
============
A tilebased RPG engine built on top of the PushButtonEngine. This is pretty much on its very early stages and here's the only game I used it on [Prologue](http://codeanginamo.com/games/prologue.html)

I keep a test page for demoing the engine's new features [here] (http://codeanginamo.com/test/rpgtest.html)

Features
--------
* Integration with the [Tiled Mapeditor] (http://www.mapeditor.org)
* XML based cutscene and dialog support
* Mouse and keyboard components


Roadmap
-------
* User interface driven script editor
* Reusable components
* Basic battle system
